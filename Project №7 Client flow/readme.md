Finding out the clients who may stop using bank's services. Classification problem.	

Different models were built and compared to each other. Random forest turned out to be the best in terms of accuracy.

Used tools: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scipy)


# Client flow

## Task

It is necessary to predict whether the client will leave the bank in the near future or not. Classification problem.	 	


## Result

 It was found that the random forest model showed the best results. We managed to achieve the required F1-measure of 0.59 on the validation data set, as well as the AUC-ROÐ¡ value of 0.85. 
 At the same time, the values of F1-measure and AUC-ROC even improved on the test data set, which indicates a good quality of the model.
