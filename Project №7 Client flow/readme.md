# Client flow

## Task

Basing on bank clients' data we have to predict whether the client will leave the bank in the near future or not. Classification problem.	 	


## Result

 The random forest model showed the best results. We managed to achieve the required F1-measure of 0.59 on the validation data set, as well as the AUC-ROÐ¡ value of 0.85. 
 At the same time, the values of F1-measure and AUC-ROC even improved on the test data set, which indicates a good quality of the model.


## Tools used

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scipy)
