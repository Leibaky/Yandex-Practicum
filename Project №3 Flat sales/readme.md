# Flat sales

## Task

Using the database of apartments sales in St. Petersburg and neighboring towns we should determine the market value of the property. In the process we should find out the anomalies and fraudulent activity.

## Result

1) The top three factors that have the greatest impact on a flat price are total area, number of the rooms and ceiling height. 
2) There has been a noticeable increase in the number of expensive apartments (which may be due to a general increase in real estate prices), while in 2019 their number fell. The number of advertisements for the sale of expensive apartments is noticeably lower in June-August and in December. 
3) Among the places with the highest number of advertisements, the lowest priced flats are located in Vyborg (2.8 million rubles), and the highest ones are in St. Petersburg (about 5 million rubles).
4) In the center of Saint-Petersburg correlation between price and area is much stronger than in the entire sample.
