# Tariff model choice

## Task

The goal is to build the best model to determine optimal telecom tariff (Smart or Ultra) with highest accuracy value basing on clients' behaviour data. 	


## Result

 The random forest has the highest accuracy (0.80), followed by the decision tree (0.79). Accuracy of logistic regression does not reach the required level. 
 At the same time, the random forest algorithm also has a higher f1-score compared to the decision tree.


## Tools used

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scipy)

## Status

Finished
