# Loan takers analysis
## Task

The goal was to analyze following issues:
1) Is there a relationship between the number of children and loan repayment on time;
2) Is there a relationship between marital status and loan repayment on time;
3) Is there a relationship between income and loan repayment on time;
4) How do different purposes of a loan affect its repayment on time?

## Result

1) The number of indebted clients does increase with the number of children from 0 to 2, however, starting from 3 children, this pattern is not observed. 
2) People who are single have a much higher percentage of debts. The lowest percentage is among widowers/widows.
3) The level of income does not affect the repayment of the loan on time.
4) Mortgage takers have the lowest percentage of indebted clients.
