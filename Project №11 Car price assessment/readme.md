# Car price assessment

## Task

Using historical data, we need to build a regression model to determine the market value of a car for a new app.


## Result

In terms of RMSE, the random forest algorithm turned out to be the best model on the test set, followed by XGBoost, CatBoost and LightGBM.
In terms of learning rate, the top three are following: LightGBM, XGBoost, and random forest. 
However, in terms of prediction speed, the TOP-3 looks different: XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost.


## Tools used
