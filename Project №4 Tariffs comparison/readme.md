# Tariffs comparison

## Task

Using data about different telecom's tariffs, we need to analyse customers' behaviour and check the following hypotheses:

1) Average revenue of two tariffs (Smart and Ultra) is different
2) Average revenue in Moscow region is different from other regions' average profit


## Result

1) Average revenue of two tariffs is actually different (alpha value is 0.05)
2) Average revenue in Moscow region and in other regions is pretty much the same (alpha value is 0.05)

## Tools used

EDA

Data engineering

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Scipy)

Hypothesis testing

## Status
