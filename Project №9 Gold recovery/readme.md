# Choosing an oil well

## Task

We should build the regression model that predicts the recovery rate of gold from gold ore basing on gold extraction and purification data.  
The model will help to optimize production.


## Result

Following discoveries were made during preparation and model building:

1) At all stages of purification, a large amount of outliers is observed, and with each stage it only increases. There is also a certain proportion of null values.
2) After comparing all models with the constant model, the random forest turned out to be the best algorithm.


## Tools used

EDA

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Scikit-learn)



## Status

Finished
