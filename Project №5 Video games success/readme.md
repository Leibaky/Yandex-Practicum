# Video games success

## Task

Using data about video games platforms, we need to determine the factors that have an effect on the popularity of a game. This will allow to focus on a potentially popular product and plan an advertising campaign. We have data up to 2016. Let's say it's December 2016 and we're planning a campaign for 2017.


## Result

We managed to describe the main differences between the regions and platforms and found the most popular genres. These are the main findings:

1) The popularity life cycle of the platform is about 5 years. According to the results of the last 5 years, the most promising platforms are PS4 and XOne.
2) The correlation between critical ratings and sales of individual games is rather weak and noticeable only after a certain level (about 70 rating points). This means that highly rated games are indeed top sellers.
3) In terms of total sales, the undisputed leaders are the action and shooter genres. However, if you look at the average or median values, shooter, sports and platform will be in the top.
4) In all three regions, the top platforms are very different. 
5) The distribution of popular genres in Europe and North America is almost identical. The top three include action, shooter and sports genres. In Japan, the distribution turned out to be completely different. The results seem to reflect cultural differences in these regions.
6) The average user ratings of the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same, but the average user ratings of the Action and Sports genres do differ.
